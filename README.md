## Internship & Capstone Design Integrated program (ICIP) ##
Internship is a good program for the students to experience the real industry environment in advance before graduation and it is also good to excite them to study harder. But, during the period of internship, it is not easy to check the progress and status of each student by the supervising professor periodically. In addition, relatively short period of internship is another problem for the students to experience real design problems in the industry field. 

Capstone design is another good program for the students to experience the entire process of engineering design but to find the proper real field problems annually is not easy for the university. 

To solve these problems and enhance the university-industry collaboration, a novel program named as Internship & Capstone Design Integrated program (ICIP) is developed by Dongguk University in Korea. In this paper, the detailed information of ICIP including the management process is introduced and the effect of ICIP is analyzed using the case studies.
